      This is an example of built-in grouping.

      WARNING: The spec/syntax not been finalized yet. Please tell us how you think it should work!

      There are four mandatory fields:

      * `key` A string expression that returns the message's key
      * `endOfGroup` A boolean expression that returns whether or not to end group and send the group messages onwards.
      * `format` What format the grouped messages should be in.
      * `storage` Where to store messages ready to be forwarded.

      [Learn about expressions](../docs/EXPRESSIONS.md)

      ### Storage

      Storage can either be:

      * An ephemeral volume - you don't mind loosing some or all messages (e.g. development or pre-production).
      * A persistent volume - you want to be to recover (e.g. production).
