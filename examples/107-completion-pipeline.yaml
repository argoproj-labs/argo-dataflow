      This example shows a pipeline running to completion.

      A pipeline that run to completion (aka "terminating") is one that will finish.

      For a pipeline to terminate one of two things must happen:

      * Every steps exits successfully (i.e. with exit code 0).
      * One step exits successfully, and is marked with `terminator: true`. When this happens, all other steps are killed.
