Replicas are automatically scaled up and down depending on the the desired formula, which can be computed using the following:

* `P` total number of pending messages.
* `p` change in number of pending messages
* `c` the current number of replicas.
* `minmax(v, min, max)` a function to constraint the minimum and maximum number of replicas.

In this example:

* Aa period is 60s
* Each replica can consume 250 messages each second
* We want to consume all pending messages in 10 periods. 

### Scale-To-Zero and Peeking

You can scale to zero. The number of replicas will be periodically scaled
to 1  so it can "peek" the the message queue. The number of pending messages is measured and the target number
of replicas re-calculated.""")
